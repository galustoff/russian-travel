                    Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
                    Primarily because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pine
                    trees,
                    mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open
                    windows in the car, you can get to know
                    with the invisible miracle of these places - mountain air.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                    The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the
                    variety
                    local flora and fauna. Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
                    and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas' cat are also inhabitants of the Altai
                    Territory.
